   abstract = {<p>There is a growing interest in multifunctional composites and in the identification of novel applications for recycled materials. In this work, the design and fabrication of multiple particle-loaded polymer composites, including micronized rubber from end-of-life tires, is studied. The integration of these composites as part of ultrasonic transducers can further expand the functionality of the piezoelectric material in the transducer in terms of sensitivity, bandwidth, ringing and axial resolution and help to facilitate the fabrication and use of phantoms for echography. The adopted approach is a multiphase and multiscale one, based on a polymeric matrix with a load of recycled rubber and tungsten powders. A fabrication procedure, compatible with transducer manufacturing, is proposed and successfully used. We also proposed a modelling approach to calculate the complex elastic modulus, the ultrasonic damping and to evaluate the relative influence of particle scattering. It is concluded that it is possible to obtain materials with acoustic impedance in the range 2.35–15.6 MRayl, ultrasound velocity in the range 790–2570 m/s, attenuation at 3 MHz, from 0.96 up to 27 dB/mm with a variation of the attenuation with the frequency following a power law with exponent in the range 1.2–3.2. These ranges of values permit us to obtain most of the material properties demanded in ultrasonic engineering.</p>},

   abstract = {Non-Contact Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (NC-RUS) has emerged as a powerful tool to determine plant water status in a non-destructive, non-invasive and rapid way. In this study, ultrasonic parameters directly obtained from experimental measurements in the field using NC-RUS - such as resonant frequency (fres), velocity (v) and Q-factor - were evaluated as potential water stress indicators in Citrus plants. The experiments were carried out in two-year-old mandarin trees (Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan. ‘Clemenules’) grown in pots in an open greenhouse where two different groups of plants were tested: a Control group (full irrigation) and a Drought Stress group (DS) whose irrigation was withdrawn during 7 days, followed by a 16 days recovery period. Soil water content, leaf water potential (Ψleaf) and the considered ultrasonic parameters were measured in the same leaves. fres detected changes between control and DS at day 7 without irrigation. Conversely, v showed differences after day 3, which were statistically significant at day 7, enabling discrimination between C and DS groups. Hence, Q-factor was the ultrasonic parameter that showed statistically significant differences between C and DS groups at days 3 and 7. Consequently, Signal Intensity in Q during the drought treatment showed a similar evolution to Ψleaf, although with slightly lower performance. However, Q-factor sensitivity excels Ψleaf at each day studied. Finally, a linear correlation (R2=0.57) between Ψleaf and Q-factor of all experimental data measured in DS group plants along the drought treatment was found. In conclusion, the ultrasonic parameters obtained using NC-RUS and in particular the Q-factor, demonstrated to be potential new water stress indicators in Citrus trees, with the novelty of being non-destructive, non-invasive and rapid. Future work should explore its suitability for its use in irrigation scheduling for Citrus trees.},

Thus, ultrasonic parameters, such as maximum wave amplitude and ultrasound velocity, and textural ones, such as hardness, elastic modulus and relaxation capacity, were measured on avocado slices. During ripening, avocado reduced its elastic modulus (from 2.29 ± 0.75 to 0.16 ± 0.08 MPa), became softer and became more viscoelastic, which was well described from zero and first-order kinetic models. These changes increased ultrasound attenuation, decreasing the maximum amplitude of the ultrasonic signal (from 336.6 to 55.4 V/m), while the ultrasonic velocity remained constant, between 320.1 ± 6.9 and 316.4 ± 82.6 m/s. Thereby, the maximum ultrasonic amplitude, which adequately correlated with textural parameters (ravg = 0.85), could be used to assess the post-harvest ripening on avocado slices.},

   abstract = {Non-contact and non-invasive materials characterization constitutes an important milestone especially in cases where strong restrictions are mandatory, such as: monitoring of fabrication processes in uncured materials, testing samples under limited access, characterizing materials that can be altered due to contact, etc. As consequence of the advance in air-coupled ultrasonic transducers, a technique such as Non-Contact Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (NC-RUS) was developed. This technique has been successfully applied in plant leaves characterization. Consequently, it was proved that effective parameters of plant leaves obtained using Non-Contact Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy enables an accurate estimation of plant water status. Nevertheless, the great potential shown by this technique was limited regarding some concerns not yet studied, such as: heterogeneity in leaf tissues, oblique incidence of the ultrasonic wave in the leaves and measurements on leaves attached to the plant. Therefore, this work is focused on the application of this technique in cases not studied so far, such as: quantifying and monitoring leaf acoustic parameters of different species while inducing changes in abiotic factors such as light and water, establishing the relationship between elastic parameters obtained by ultrasonic measurements and the microstructure of plant tissues, extracting mechanical parameters of each layer within the leaf and generating and detecting shear waves in plant tissues. Results collected in this work show the variation in the mechanical of plant leaves attached to the plant at ultrasonic frequencies, as a consequence of their response under light and watering alterations. Furthermore, elastic values obtained using ultrasonic techniques that propagate shear and guided waves in plant tissues reveal a link between them and the microstructure observed. Additionally, acoustic parameters from different layers within the sample at ultrasonic frequencies were extracted, both at normal and oblique incidence in wideband ([0.1 – 1.6] MHz). This was demonstrated not only in plant leaves but also in synthetic materials. From this work, we conclude that Non-Contact Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (NC-RUS) technique is a powerful tool for characterization, monitoring and control of plants in the ecophysiology field. Moreover, it demonstrates that the NC-RUS technique and procedures developed in this thesis work, adds a significant value to materials characterization not only in synthetic materials but also in biological tissues such plant leaves, where it is possible to infer the microstructure in a non-destructive and non-invasive way. v},

These networks exhibit a unique hierarchical architecture in which thin layers with honeycomb-like structure and internal strut length in the order of 1–10 µm in size are aligned with an interlayer spacing ranging between 15 and 50 µm. The resulting structures exhibit strengths (up to 3MPa) and stiffness (up to 0.3 GPa) that are higher than aerogels of similar density and comparable to other ceramic microlattices fabricated by vapor deposition. Furthermore, this wet processing technique allows the fabrication of large-size samples that are stable at high temperature, with acoustic impedance that can be manipulated over one order of magnitude (0.03–0.3MRayl), electrically conductive and with very low thermal conductivity. The approach can be extended to other ceramic materials and opens new opportunities for the fabrication of ultralight structures with unique mechanical and functional properties in practical dimensions.},

   abstract = {Described here is the application of a technique based on the excitation, sensing and spectral analysis of thickness resonances of plant leaves using air-coupled and wide-band ultrasound pulses (150-900 kHz) to monitor variations in leaf properties caused by plant responses to different environmental stimuli, such as a sudden variation in light intensity (from 2000 to 150 μmol m(-2) s(-1)), sudden watering after a drought period, and along the diurnal cycle (3-5 days, with continuous variation in light intensity from 150 to 2000 μmol m(-2) s(-1) and change in temperature of about 5°C). Four different widely available species, both monocots and dicots and evergreen and deciduous, with different leaf features (shape, size, thickness, flatness, vascular structure), were selected to test the technique. After a sudden decrease in light intensity, and depending on the species, there was a relative increase in the thickness resonant frequency from 8% to 12% over a 25- to 50-min period. After sudden watering, the relative increase in the resonant frequency varied from 5% to 30% and the period from 10 to 400 min. Finally, along the diurnal cycle, the measured relative variation is between 4% and 10%. The technique revealed differences in both the amplitude of the frequency oscillations and the kinetics of the leaf response for different species and also within the same species, but for specimens grown under different conditions that present different cell structures at the tissue level. The technique can be equally applied to the leaves of any species that present thickness resonances.},

   abstract = {The large water requirements of L. together with an increase in temperature and drought events imply the need for irrigation in the driest areas of its distribution range. Generous watering may reduce grape quality so irrigation should be precisely regulated through the development of new methods of accurate irrigation scheduling based on plant ‘stress sensing’. Two new methods, the reflectivity in the S-band and the broadband ultrasonic spectroscopy, can be used as non-invasive and reproducible techniques for the study of plant water relations in . On one hand, the measurement of reflectance at frequencies around 2.4GHz gives an excellent accuracy when the changes in the existing area (S) between two reflectance curves are correlated with the relative water content (RWC). On the other hand, an improvement of the broadband ultrasonic spectroscopy based on the enlargement of the analysis frequency window provides, apart from the determination of the turgor loss point (TLP), additional information about the leaves without additional computational cost or additional leaf information requirements. Before TLP, the frequency associated with the maximum transmittance (f/fo), the macroscopic elastic constant of the leaf in the Z direction (c33) and, specially, the variation of the attenuation coefficient with the frequency (n), were highly correlated with changes in RWC. Once turgor is lost, a shift in the parameters directly related to the attenuation of the signal was also observed. The use of both techniques allows for a more convincing knowledge of the water status in .},
